Task Description:

You are building a FastAPI application to manage a list of users. Your application should expose an endpoint to receive user data in JSON format and validate the incoming data. Additionally, the application should return a JSON response with specific details.

Requirements:

Create a FastAPI application with a single endpoint to handle user data.

Define a JSON schema for the expected user data. The user data should include at least the following fields: username, email, and age.

Implement JSON validation using the Pydantic library to ensure that incoming requests comply with the defined schema. If the incoming JSON does not match the schema, return a meaningful error response.

Upon successful validation, generate a JSON response with the following format:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "User data received successfully",
  "user": {
    "username": "provided-username",
    "email": "provided-email",
    "age": provided-age
  }
}
Test your FastAPI application by sending HTTP requests with valid and invalid JSON payloads to ensure that the validation and response generation work as expected.
